# Data Engineering Project
This is a data engineering project that consists of four stages. The project is designed to give a hands-on experience with designing and implementing various data engineering tasks.

### Stage 1: Data Platform Architecture and OLTP Database

In this stage, design the schema for the OLTP database and load data into the database. also automate administrative tasks. The following components are included in this stage:

- Designing the schema for the OLTP database
+ Loading data into the OLTP database
* Automating administrative tasks

### Stage 2: Querying data in NoSQL database

In this stage, import data into a MongoDB database, query data in the database, and export data from the database. The following components are included in this stage:

- Importing data into a MongoDB database
+ Querying data in a MongoDB database
* Exporting data from a MongoDB database

### Stage 3: Build a Data Warehouse

In this stage, design and implement a data warehouse and then generate reports from the data in the data warehouse. The following components are included in this stage:

- Designing a data warehouse using DataGrip ERD design tool
+ Loading data into the data warehouse
* Writing aggregation queries
- Creating Materialized Query Table

### Stage 4: Data Pipelines Using Apache AirFlow

In this stage, author an Apache Airflow DAG that will extract data from a web server log file, transform the data, and load the transformed data into a tar file. The following components are included in this stage:

- Authoring an Apache Airflow DAG
+ Extracting the IP address field from a webserver log file
* Filtering out specific IP addresses from the log file
+ Loading the data by archiving the transformed text file into a TAR file

### Conclusion
In this project, I have designed and implemented various data engineering tasks, including designing a database schema, querying data in a NoSQL database, building a data warehouse, and creating data pipelines using Apache Airflow. I hope that this project has given a good simulating of the data engineering process and some of the tools and technologies used in this field.
