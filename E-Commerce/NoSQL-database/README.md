## Project Name
Querying data in NoSQL database - Stage 2

## Project Overview
This project is the second stage of a larger project to design a data platform architecture and OLTP database. The objective of this stage is to import data into a MongoDB database, query the data in the database, and export the data. The project is implemented using Python and MongoDB.

##Components
The project consists of the following components:

1. Import Data into MongoDB Database: In this component, data is imported into the MongoDB database from a CSV file using Python. The data includes customer information, product information, and order information.

2. Query Data in MongoDB Database: In this component, data is queried in the MongoDB database using Python. The queries include finding customers who have spent the most money, finding products that are frequently purchased together, and finding orders that have not been shipped yet.

3. Export Data from MongoDB: In this component, data is exported from the MongoDB database to a CSV file using Python. The exported data includes customer information, product information, and order information.
